# MegaWar

This is a C++ program that is a modified version of the card game War. Instead, in this game, there can be more than one deck and more than two players. 
The user will enter the amount of decks and the amount of players and the game will automatically generate the outcome by playing the game entirely. The winner of the game will the player who accumulates all the cards in the game.
